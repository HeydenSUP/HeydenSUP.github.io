        <header><p>First Attention</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          In an interactive experience, I'm more concerned with maneuverability,
          which can also be described as how many elements there are to interact
          with. I'm more interested in whether the page will surprise me than in
          the overwhelming content.

        <header><p>Discrete Action</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          This web page is made up of left and right parts
          <ul>
            <li>
              1 The left frame hides some stickers with Christmas elements
            </li>
            <li>2 These stickers can be rearranged and combined</li>
            <li>
              3 The right side allows me to sad swipe to see information about
              the use of the page and some of the content
            </li>
            <li>
              4 The text in the fifth cell on the left can be clicked to change
              the background color.

        <header><p>Most Engagement</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          In my experience, I spent more time viewing the articles on the right
          part of the page
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="question-box">
        <header><p>Common Action</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          The most action I did during the experience was clicking around and
          swiping up and down, because the left part of the page is fixed, but
          there are little surprises with Christmas elements hidden inside each
          little box, and on the right side there are articles and web page
          introductions, so I was swiping all the way around to find the
          interesting little surprises.

        <header><p>Primary Goal Impression</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          The primary goal of MyoungAe Kim's interactive experience on her
          website is to showcase her portfolio of graphic and digital design
          work. The layout is designed to highlight her skills and creativity,
          making it easy for potential clients or employers to view her diverse
          range of projects and understand her capabilities in a visually
          appealing format.

      </div>
      <div class="question-box">
        <header><p>communication of Goal</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          The interactive experience on this website communicates its primary
          goal through a minimalist design that uses clean, organized grids and
          interactive elements. Each project is presented in a way that invites
          the user to click and explore further, with detailed explanations and
          images that pop up on interaction, effectively conveying her
          professional expertise and artistic vision. You can see this for
          yourself on her website.

      </div>
      <div class="question-box">
        <header><p>Interaction Over Time</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          The experience on this website seems designed for relatively
          short-term interactions where visitors explore her work in a single
          session.At least that's what I did three times during my experience.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="question-box">
        <header><p>Communication Over Time</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          The website uses a user-friendly interface that subtly guides visitors
          on how to interact through visual cues and minimalistic design. The
          layout promotes exploration but doesn't specifically communicate a
          long-term interaction strategy.

      <div class="question-box">
        <header><p>Media References</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          The website references digital media forms primarily, such as digital
          graphics, interactive design elements, and possibly animation. These
          references showcase the integration of modern design tools and
          techniques, reflecting the digital nature of her work.

      <div class="question-box">
        <header><p>Emotional Guidance from References</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          A website's references to digital forms of media may be meant to evoke
          a sense of innovation and modernity. This practice suggests that
          visitors should feel engaged and inspired as they browse through her
          work.

      <div class="question-box">
        <header><p>Most Frustrating Part</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          The part that I don't think is working well is that the pages are
          relatively monotonous and empty, like some kind of report or
          presentation PowerPoint. it's not very attractive for the user to stay
          on the page for a long time.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="question-box">
        <header><p>Most Satisfying Part</p></header>
        <div class="response">
          The good thing about this web page is that the information guidelines
          are very clear and concise, and the content is expressed in the most
          intuitive way, so that people do not understand the purpose of the web
          page after operation, and the web page also has some interactive
          surprises!
